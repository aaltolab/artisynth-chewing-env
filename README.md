# chewing-pertubation
This script runs a inverse chewing simulation in artisynth. A trajectory is programmed in artisynth, muscle excitations are calculated and then collected within this script. The simulation time, time step, sampling frequency, and pertubation model paramters, and number of simulations can be set.

Plotting functions are defined in your workingdir/Plot Functions. Helper functions are defined in your workingdir/Helper Functions These functions are called within the main script. Saved simulations is an empty folder that you should fill with the contents of the Output folder which collects all of the simulation data and statistical data.
